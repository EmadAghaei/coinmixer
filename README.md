This is a coin mixer, it is one way to maintain your privacy on the crypto network.

It completes the below steps:

1. You provide a list of new, unused addresses that you own to the mixer;
2. The mixer provides you with a new deposit address that it owns;
3. You transfer your bitcoins to that address;
4. The mixer will detect your transfer by watching or polling the P2P Bitcoin network;
5. The mixer will transfer your bitcoin from the deposit address into a big “house account” along with all the other bitcoin currently being mixed; and
Then, 
6. over some time the mixer will use the house account to dole out your bitcoin in smaller discrete increments to the withdrawal addresses that you provided, possibly after deducting a fee.
